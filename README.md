# social-imageboard

A social imageboard. Made at Makers to teach myself and play around
with various concepts in web app design; not remotely suitable for production use.

[Example app instance on Heroku](http://social-imageboard.herokuapp.com)

###Features

- Javascript as-you-type filtering by tag, including negative filters (e.g.
  '-animated' filters out all posts tagged with 'animated')
